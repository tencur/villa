# Fail-closed TIFXYZ/volume preflight

`vesuvius.surface_preflight` checks that a TIFXYZ surface is structurally
usable and, when provided, paired with the intended Zarr/OME-Zarr CT volume
before an expensive render, label transfer, or inference run starts.

Install the geometry I/O dependencies and run:

```bash
pip install "vesuvius[label-transfer]"
vesuvius.surface_preflight \
  --surface /path/to/segment.tifxyz \
  --volume /path/to/scroll.zarr \
  --output preflight.json
```

To validate a surface without opening a CT volume, omit `--volume`:

```bash
vesuvius.surface_preflight \
  --surface /path/to/segment.tifxyz \
  --output preflight.json
```

For an OME-Zarr with a nonstandard hierarchy, `--array-key` may explicitly
select its base-resolution array. Non-base arrays are rejected because TIFXYZ
coordinates are expressed in base-resolution voxel space. By default the
command selects the first dataset declared by OME-Zarr `multiscales`, then
falls back to array `0` or the only array in the group. A volume path that
selects a concrete array inside a `.zarr` group is resolved through that group
and must select its base dataset. Standalone single-array stores remain valid.

An `s3://` volume is opened with the configured AWS credentials first. If that
fails because credentials are missing, expired, or rejected, the command
retries with unsigned requests, so `s3://vesuvius-challenge-open-data/...`
volume URIs copied from the open-data catalog work on a machine with no AWS
setup. A private bucket still reports the original credential error.

The command checks:

- required TIFXYZ files, metadata, coordinate shapes, and optional mask
  compatibility, including canonical multipage and integer-scaled masks;
- at least one valid vertex and connected quad;
- finite selected coordinates;
- consistency between metadata scale and adjacent grid spacing;
- consistency between metadata `bbox` and valid coordinate bounds when `bbox`
  is present;
- exact valid-coordinate bounds in the selected CT array, including an
  optional `--margin`;
- deterministic, evenly ranked surface samples for nonzero CT signal support.

The `tifxyz_scale_consistency` gate compares the median adjacent grid spacing
against the reciprocal metadata scale. The median is estimated from a
logarithmic histogram (64 bins per octave), so the report also records the
median bin bounds (`median_spacing_bounds_voxels`, `ratio_range`) and the gate
fails only when the whole bin falls outside the accepted ratio range; a grid
exactly at the tolerance boundary passes. Adjust the accepted range with
`--scale-tolerance` (default `2.0`, minimum `1.0`). When metadata contains a
`bbox`, the `tifxyz_bbox_consistency` gate checks that all valid coordinates
fit inside it. Adjust its coverage allowance with `--bbox-tolerance` (default
`0.01` voxels, minimum `0`).

The JSON report schema is version `2` and records every required gate and its
observed value. Exit code `0` means every gate passed; exit code `2` means at
least one gate failed or an input could not be read. The report is written
atomically, so downstream jobs can require a complete `PASS` report rather
than guessing from partial output.

Signal support defaults to at least 95% of 1,024 deterministic samples with
absolute CT value greater than zero. Use `--minimum-support-fraction`,
`--max-samples`, or `--support-threshold` when a volume has a documented
different fill-value convention. Threshold changes are recorded in the
report.

A signal-support failure means the selected volume does not contain enough
nonzero signal at the sampled surface coordinates. This can indicate a wrong
pairing, a cropped, sparse, or partially populated volume store, or genuinely
unsupported surface coverage; it is not by itself evidence that the surface
geometry is defective.

This is an input-pairing preflight, not a proof of surface correctness. It does
not replace geometric diagnostics such as self-intersection or local
orientation analysis.

## Example: catching an empty `vc_obj2tifxyz` export

Round-tripping the public Scroll 1 segment
`https://dl.ash2txt.org/community-uploads/bruniss/scrolls/s1/autogens/02201554/`
(196x225 grid, `scale = [0.05, 0.05]`) through `vc_tifxyz2obj` and then
`vc_obj2tifxyz --uv-non-metric` (VC3D build `f07d33b`) produced a 2x2 grid with
no valid points, yet the converter exited `0`:

```text
Final grid: 2 x 2
Valid grid points: 0 / 4 (0%)
Warning: no valid grid points were rasterized.
Saving to tifxyz format...
Successfully converted to tifxyz format
```

Before this change the preflight could not inspect that output without a CT
volume (`error: the following arguments are required: --volume`). Now:

```bash
vesuvius.surface_preflight --surface out_nonmetric --output preflight.json
```

```text
FAIL: preflight.json
valid_surface_vertices: surface has no valid vertices (all coordinates are sentinel/invalid); the producer emitted an empty grid
valid_surface_quads: surface has no connected valid quads
tifxyz_scale_consistency: grid has no positive columns spacing pairs to compare with meta.json scale
tifxyz_bbox_consistency: no valid vertices to compare against bbox
```

with exit code `2`. The same segment re-exported with
`--tifxyz-source=<segment>` (224x195 grid, `scale = [0.05, 0.05]`) passes: the
measured median spacing is `19.98` voxels per cell against the `20.0` implied
by the metadata.
