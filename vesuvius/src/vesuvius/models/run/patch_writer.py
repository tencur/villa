class BoundedPatchWriter:
    """Thread-pooled writer with a bounded in-flight queue.

    Wraps a ThreadPoolExecutor so the producer (inference loop) blocks once
    ``max_workers * 2`` write tasks are pending. This prevents the executor's
    internal queue from growing unbounded and pinning a float16 patch per
    pending task in host RAM when the sink (e.g. S3) is slower than the GPU.

    Also measures producer wait time and emits throttled stall reports via the
    provided tqdm bar, so an operator can see immediately when the GPU is idle
    waiting on writes.
